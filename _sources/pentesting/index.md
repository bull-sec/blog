# Penetration Testing

Quick summary of each section and the sort of things each one contains.

- *000 Ground Work* - Covers the very basics from notetaking to the legal things you should consider before you even engage on a penetration test
- *001 Passive Recon (OSINT)* - Covers the use of Open Source Intelligence sources to gather information about a potential target
- *002 Active Recon* - Covers the active use of scanners and probes against identified targets
- *003 Service Enumeration* - Looking at a number of common services and the ways in which they can be interrogated for information
- *004 Web Exploitation* - All things browser based
- *005 Foothold* - Covering a few topics such as 'File Transfers', Reverse Shells, and some miscellaneous tutorials which could help you secure a foothold on a target

Everything is a constant work in progress, so some bits may change. If there are any *massive* changes made to anything then a note will be attached to show:

```{note}
Nothing has changed here, but if it did then there would be a note like this at the top of the page summarising the changes and the date they were made
```
