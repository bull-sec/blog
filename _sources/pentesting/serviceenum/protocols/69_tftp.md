# TFTP - Port 69

TFTP runs on UDP port 69 and *requires no authentication*, it's a pure protocol based service that allows you to read and write to files using the `datagram format` (that'll be the D in UDP in case you were about to Google)

Rare to find these days based on the aforementioned lack of authentication and the unmentioned but very real lack of encryption or transport level security of any kind but it's always worth checking for on a UDP scan in case someone left one turned on.

TFTP doesn't give directory listings so we can use:

```bash
nmap -n -Pn -sU -p69 -sV --script tftp-enum
```

If we find something we want to download, or if we decide we want to upload we can use the following Python script:

```python
import tftpy
client = tftpy.TftpClient(<ip>, <port>)
client.download("filename in server", "/path/to/file/", timeout=5)
client.upload("filename to upload", "/path/to/upload/", timeout=5)
```

That's pretty much it, we can upload, or download, and we can list files using an Nmap script. Probably becoming quite clear why this is pretty rare to see these days.
