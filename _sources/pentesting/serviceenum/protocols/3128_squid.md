# Squid - Port 3128

Squid is a proxy service.

It sits in front of whatever it's configured to sit in front of although it will probably be HTTP.

---

You can configure "Foxy Proxy" to use it, or set it in your `proxychains` config file `/etc/proxychains4.conf`.

The entry should be `http $ip $port`.

Sometimes it's configured to use Basic HTTP authentication, which means we'll need a username and password to gain access.

Make sure to comment out any other active connections like SOCKS proxies (by default you'll have one setup for 9050)

You'll then be hitting `localhost` to access the site. Just bear that in mind that it's being proxied and you should be fine.

```bash
proxychains curl http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

## Abusing the Proxy

We can sometimes use the proxy to scan the inside of the target machine:

```bash
proxychains nmap -sT -n -p- localhost
```

Note that this can be a pretty poor method of scanning and will at best give you an idea of open ports, you're not going to be running full on `-sV` scans using this kind of a tunnel.
