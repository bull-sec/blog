# POP - Post Office Protocol

POP is an email protocol which can extract mail and mail information from any other mail server that it has access to (POP is the receiving protocol, SMTP or something else would be used to actually send the mail)

It runs on port 110, or 995 in the case of the secure variant.

We will generally require credentials to access, though we can automate and bruteforce our login if we have something to work from (such as a username or some information on the password).

```bash
# Grab the banner
nc -nv {IP} 110
```

```bash
# Grab the secure banner
openssl s_client -connect <IP>:995 -crlf -quiet
```

```bash
# Nmap scan for POP information
nmap --scripts "pop3-capabilities or pop3-ntlm-info" -sV -port 110 <IP>
```

```bash
POP commands:
  USER uid           Log in as "uid"
  PASS password      Substitue "password" for your actual password
  STAT               List number of messages, total mailbox size
  LIST               List messages and sizes
  RETR n             Show message n
  DELE n             Mark message n for deletion
  RSET               Undo any changes
  QUIT               Logout (expunges messages if no RSET)
  TOP msg n          Show first n lines of message number msg
  CAPA               Get capabilities
```
