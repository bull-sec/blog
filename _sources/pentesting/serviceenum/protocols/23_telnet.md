# Telnet - Port 23

Telnet, or "How I exposed my network to hackers"

Seriously if Telnet is running there is a problem, and it's very presence is worthy of mention in a report.

Telnet is essentially SSH but with out the (S)ecure part.

It's super rare to see it in the wild these days unless you operate in a world of much older devices (such as certain types of critical infrastructure) or if you're on a CTF as it'll sometimes pop up on those. 

Generally speaking you'll either face no authentication, or it will be a simple login prompt asking for a username:password combination (usual stuff), once in you're at the mercy of whatever the system is configured to do once you log in. Most of the time you'll drop into a shell and be able to issue commands as if it were an SSH session (but again without the (S)ecure part).

Bear in mind that it is completely unencrypted, so whatever you're sending is clear on the wire (including passwords and anything that you read from the server)

> In some rare cases you might have to use `telnet` to connect to a machine due to an  instances where `nc` or `ncat` will only send a `0a` character instead of `0d0A` which is a full CRLF and  as such your connection will fail

## Connecting

```bash
telnet 10.10.10.10 23
```

## Banner Grabbing

```bash
nc -vn 10.10.10.10 23
```

## Escape Character

When you connect to Telnet it'll tell you what the "Escape Character" is but in general:

```bash
^] # Ctrl + Right square bracket
```
