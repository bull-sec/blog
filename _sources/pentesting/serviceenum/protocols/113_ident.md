# Ident

A really simple protocol that can give us the usernames of whoever is running a service on a target machine.

We can use `ident-user-enum`, which is a nice little Perl script to do most of the dirty work for us.

[pentestmonkey/ident-user-enum](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/ident-user-enum/master/ident-user-enum.pl)

To use it we just give it an `ip` and a `port` or a bunch of `ports` depending on what we want to check (or what services are running)

```bash
$> ident-user-enum 192.168.1.100 22 113 139 445 8080

ident-user-enum v1.0 ( http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/ident-user-enum )
