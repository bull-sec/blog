# Windows PrivEsc

Initially Privilege Escalation on Windows systems feels a bit harder due to the lack of visibility of some of your changes, but in reality you'll make use of some pretty similar tricks such as taking advantage of file paths and dropping pre-compiled exploits.

You'll generally find that there is almost always a new exploit that Microsoft either can't or won't fix and most of them have POC available on the likes of Github. If you can't abuse the system itself you can probably find an application or service with badly set up permissions and take advantage of that instead.
