# Welcome to the Jungle

Finally decided that there needs to be a central repository of knowledge.

Played around with a lot of static site generators, this one is the simplest to use in the sense that the Markdown files it consumes are just pure Markdown and don't require some special formatting or header in order to work properly. The `# Header` is the title of the page and the link you'll see in the side bar.

Everything relies on the `_toc.yaml` and `_config.yaml` files that you'll find in the build folder. Also included in there is a script to perform the build, so all you'll need to do is update the `_toc.yaml` with the addition(s) that you've made to the Jupyter Book.

Speaking of Jupyter, yes, this can do Jupyter Notebook things, which means it can be used as a place to store playbooks for incident response and things like that.

```{note}
Please make sure that all information stored within this has been sanitised to prevent any unintentional data leakage or Doxxxing.

Cheers,
```

*If possible try to keep all your notes in the third person, i.e. use "we" instead of "I"*
